# runtimes
Runtimes for Senserva - early beta please contact us for assistance and information.    These are runtimes only, source available upon request and approval by Senserva.

These run times do not require and services, cloud or otherwise.  The run local and the data stays local.  Web page UI runs off local data, the database is a no server SQLite database. 

There are 3 components, the Inquisitor that reads tenants and puts audit data into a SQlite database.  The Senserva Report Generator reads the database and creates local web files for you to view.  The Senserva Remediator will correct things based on your rules (release coming in a future beta)
